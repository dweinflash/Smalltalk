# Smalltalk Project
The project in general covers Smalltalk, but code snippets are written in Pharo, a modern dialect of the Smalltalk language. It can be installed using the instructions at [https://pharo.org/download](https://pharo.org/download). The 'Pharo Standalone' instructions will allow you to run scripts from the command line with a command similar to `./pharo Pharo.image eval "42 factorial"`.
